I am a 1st-year PhD student of cancer epidemiology in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. 

Prior to joining Hopkins, I was a biostatistician at Mount Sinai Hospital, NY for 4 years, where I provided statistical consultation and performed data analysis for clinical cancer studies, mostly on **breast cancer**, **prostate cancer** and **radiation oncology**. I also helped the clinical investigators develop **early-phase clinical trial** protocols to ensure adequate study design and sufficient statistical power. 

For my PhD study, I'm interested in utilizing novel statistical genetic methods to find the association of genetic markers in the multi-omics data and cancer outcomes.
